### OpenAI: 
> **OpenAI is a company in the artificial intelligence (AI) research and deployment field**

**Incorporation Date**: OpenAI was founded on December 11, 2015.

**Founders**:
- [**Elon Musk**](https://www.britannica.com/money/Elon-Musk): CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, co-founder of Neuralink.
- [**Sam Altman**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sam-Altman): Former president of Y Combinator and current CEO of OpenAI.
- [**Greg Brockman**](https://gregbrockman.com/): Former CTO of Stripe and current CTO of OpenAI.
- [**Ilya Sutskever**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/): Former research scientist at Google Brain and current Chief Scientist at OpenAI.
- [**Wojciech Zaremba**](https://goldpenguin.org/blog/who-is-wojciech-zaremba/): Researcher and co-founder of OpenAI, specializing in deep learning.
- [**John Schulman**](http://joschu.net/): Research scientist and co-founder, known for work in reinforcement learning.

**Idea Origin**:

  The idea for OpenAI emerged from a shared concern among the founders about the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence. They believed that AI could either benefit humanity immensely or pose significant risks if not developed responsibly. The founding team was motivated by the desire to ensure that AI technology would be used safely and ethically for the benefit of all, leading them to create OpenAI as a non-profit research organization focused on advancing AI in a way that is safe, transparent, and beneficial.

**Funding**:

  OpenAI initially started as a non-profit organization, and it received backing from several prominent investors, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman, among others. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned to a "capped-profit" model with the establishment of OpenAI LP, which allows for limited returns on investments while ensuring that any excess profits are reinvested into the company‚Äôs mission.
- *Total Funding*: OpenAI has raised over $11 billion in total funding as of 2023. The most significant investment came from Microsoft, which invested $1 billion in 2019 and committed to additional investments to support the development of AGI and its integration with Microsoft‚Äôs Azure cloud platform.
